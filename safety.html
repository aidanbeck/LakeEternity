                <h2>Safety Tips!</h2>
                <p>Here are some helpful guidelines to keep yourself and your family safe on the lake!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wear sunscreen diligently! Yes, even when it's cloudy!</li>
                    <li>Always supervise children aged 0-10 and 12-15. 11 year olds can fend for themselves.</li>
                    <li>Avoid life jackets! In emergencies, they often get in the way of your ability to swim. Big Jacket is lying to you!</li>
                    <li>If you see anything abnormal, contact the Clark Lifeguarding Division!</li>
                    <li>If you have an emergency, contact the Clark Lifeguarding Division!</li>
                    <li>To report a missing person, contact the Clark Lifeguarding Division! It is imperative that you do not contact any other organization as they will not be as efficient as the Clark Lifeguarding Division and are likely to just get in the way.</li>
                    <li>Wait at least 30 minutes after eating before swimming!</li>
                </ul>
