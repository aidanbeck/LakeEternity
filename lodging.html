                        <p>The breakfast was decently good, I would rate ~3.5 stars. The view was stunning, something about the water is just so beautiful and you get a great a great view of it. It almost doesn't look real, I can't put it into words.</p>

                        <p>Wait I meant to comment on the restaurant, I didn't stay at the Inn. How do I delete this?</p>

                        <p>This is so weird- How does this place stay open? I haven't seen anyone since I've gotten here. All the lights are on but no one else seems to be here except me. Breakfast is always hot and ready in the morning, but I haven't seen another staff member or even fellow tourist. My room is always impeccably clean when I return, but I've never seen a maid. It's like I have this whole place to myself. 10/10 service, but I feel like I'm going crazy!</p>

                        <p>I'm not sure what Sarah is talking about, it seems normal to me. Fair amount of tourists. Breakfast is still decently good, I guess that hasn't changed haha.</p>

                        <p>Can confirm on the breakfast being good, but don't eat the clams. My girlfriend ate them and got super sick.</p>
