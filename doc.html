        <p>The election for mayor in 1941 saw the leadership of the town transfer to a new family, as Josephine Maxwell beat Florence's son (Alfred Clark) for the title. The title of Mayor remained in the Maxewell family until the election of 1969, which ended in an exact tie between Jonathan Maxwell-Smith and Clark Blackwood. While the town debated on how to handle the tie, the entirety of the Maxwell family disappeared the morning of November 14th, 1969. The town had no mayor for 4 years as an investigation took place, but nothing was uncovered and Clark Blackwood became the mayor in 1973.
            * Alfred Clark lost the election because he made people uneasy with some of his ideas, and they were worried he would not run the town with the seperation of church & state.
            * Alfred never had children, but his legacy continued on through his congregation. They began to self mythologize the Clark family.</p><p>
            * They used the lake water as holy water for worship purposes. This led the lake monster to begin stirring, as it felt their rage for being thrown out of power.
            * The election of 1969 was their chance, but after a tie, it was the Maxwell administration in charge of deciding the parameters for breaking it. The rumor was that they would be unfair, though this may have just been distrustful speculation.
            * Florence Blackwood, sister of Clark Blackwood, went exploring in the caves when she discovered a tunnel that descended into water. She slipped, dropping her light which fell into the inky black void before extinguishing. After a moment, a deep groaning told her that they could regain power in the election if she poured a bucket of lake water and clams into the chimneys of the Maxewell family houses.
            * When she felt convinced, she suddenly felt the water rushing up towards her. She thought she was drowning and she thrashed around blindly in the current, hitting her limbs on rocks and stone. She woke up at the enterance of the cave.</p>
