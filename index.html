            <strong>The History of Lake Eternity</strong><br>
            
            <p>In world war 1, a pair of siblings went to France to aide the war effort. Florence Clark as an ambulance driver, and Arthur Clark as a soldier. They were seperated to perform their respective duties, but would meet again under unfortunate circumstances. Florence found Arthur with a major 

                Florence drove as fast as she could to get him help, but it was too late. Arthur made her promise to realise the dream they both had as kids, to move out of the city and find their own little piece of american frontier. If their dream stayed alive, then in a way, so would he.
                
                When she returned, she would do exactly that. She settled in a cabin near what would be named Lake Eternity, and founded the town of Arthur, Minnesota in 1921.</p>

            <p>During the great depression, you would think that a town would struggle to grow through the economic troubles of the time. However, the crops of Arthur Minnesota would be extremely bountiful, especially compared to the dust bowl plauging the rest of the country. Legends began to spread of the magical growth properties of the lake's water, giving the lake it's name. Enternal prosperity, even during times of great hardship.</p>

            <p>The election for mayor in 1941 saw the leadership of the town transfer to a new family, as Josephine Maxwell beat Florence's son (Alfred Clark) for the title. The title of Mayor remained in the Maxewell family until the election of 1969, which ended in an exact tie between Jonathan Maxwell-Smith and Clark Blackwood. While the town debated on how to handle the tie, the entirety of the Maxwell family disappeared the morning of November 14th, 1969. The town had no mayor for 4 years as an investigation took place, but nothing was uncovered and Clark Blackwood became the mayor in 1973.</p>
